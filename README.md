## AI 3460:460 LISP game

This is the game of Tic-Tac-Toe implemented in lisp. Most of this code is from
Dr. Chan. I've just implemented [the
requirements](http://cs.uakron.edu/~chan/cs460/Fall%202013/460p1.htm)

### Usage

To play the game simply execute the `play` script on the command line,
`./play-one-game`.  You can also execute the game by loading it into the clisp
REPL and calling the `play-one-game` function.
